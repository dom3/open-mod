# Open Mod
Help smaller creators get recognition and play a role in the active rating of levels.

- To rate a level, go to a level and at the top left of the level you can press the "Rate" button to rate it.
- You can not rate the same level until your rate expires.
- Your "rate" expires after a day.
- In the level search menu, you can view the most rated levels. For moderators, this is a useful tool to see levels that the community wants rated.
- You can rate a level again when your rate expires.
